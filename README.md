### Final Project 02456 DEEP LEARNING, DTU COMPUTE, AUTUMN 2021

**Files:**
- **DL_final_Project_CAE_best_version_noise.ipynb** - final CAE for quality improvement if images form CIFAR-10 and STL10 datasets 
- **final.pth** - trained CAE (from DL_final_Project_CAE_best_version_noise.ipynb) for image quality improvement
- **brightness.ipynb** - CAE for repairing brightness issue of images from CIFAR-10 dataset
- **noise.ipynb** - CAE for repairing noise issue of images from CIFAR-10 dataset
- **DL_final_Project_CAE_reconstruction.ipynb** - Base CAE for image reconstruction from the CIFAR-10 dataset
